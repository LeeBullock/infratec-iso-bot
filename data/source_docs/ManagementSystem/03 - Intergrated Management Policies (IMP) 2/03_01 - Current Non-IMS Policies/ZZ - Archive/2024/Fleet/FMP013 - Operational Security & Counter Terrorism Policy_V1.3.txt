  OPERATIONAL SECURITY  & COUNTER TERRORISMO  POLICY  INFRATEC-UK recognise the threat to operational security and terrorism to its operations. It is INFRATEC-UK’s policy to ensure our operations remain safe and secure to protect our drivers and the safety of the general public by identifying security threats, our vulnerabilities and ways in which these threats can be minimised. Security threats can be direct (where the organisation is the target) or indirect (where the organisation is not the target but deals with the consequences). Direct threats include, but are not limited to: • Threats targeting assets that contain secure data. • Threats from the recruitment of terrorists. • Theft of vehicles, stolen or exploited by terrorists – including Vehicle as a Weapon (VAW) Attack Indirect threats include, but are not limited to: • Emergence of a new virus effecting IT networks • Terrorists targeting major infrastructure systems such as motorways. These threats potentially provide vulnerabilities within: • People – staff and customers • Physical assets – buildings, vehicles and equipment Although we accept the limitations of any security measures in providing total protection, INFRATEC-UK will implement the following measures, and those detailed in FMD009 – Operational Security & Counter Terrorism Procedure to provide as much security as possible: • Ensure all employees are aware of this policy. • Ensure all vehicles security devices are in working order. • Ensure all vehicles are fitted with a tracking device and have an appropriate geo-fencing to provide management with notifications on whereabouts. • Ensure all assets that contain secure data are securely locked away when not in use. • Ensure that all drivers complete the FORS Professional Security and Counter Terrorism eLearning module and provide ongoing training and toolbox talks to staff on the security measures. • Ensure the following checks are made during the recruitment process when recruiting new employees: o Employment history (from New Starter Form) o Fitness to drive (FMP012 - Driver Fitness & Health Policy) o Qualifications and licences (FMD05 - Driver Eligibility Check Procedure) o Ability or eligibility to work (from New Starter Form) • Appoint the Transport Manager as a Counter Terrorism Champion to: o The creation and implementation of the organisation's emergency response plan(s).  o Ensure this policy is reviewed, signed off and communicated, with any alterations also effectively communicated to all staff. o Ensure staff feel confident in performing their duties set out in the policy. o Ensure that the emergency and business continuity plan is followed through in the event of an emergency to allow for a quick response and a swift return to 'business as usual'. o Ensure any relevant information or evidence is collected and reported to the emergency services and senior management, promptly.
