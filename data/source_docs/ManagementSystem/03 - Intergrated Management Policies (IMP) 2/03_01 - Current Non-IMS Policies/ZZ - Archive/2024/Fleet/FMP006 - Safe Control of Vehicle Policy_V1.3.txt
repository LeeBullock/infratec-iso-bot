  SAFE CONTROL OF  VEHICLE MOVEMENTSO  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  The health & safety of our drivers, vulnerable road users and the travelling public is fundamental to our operations. INFRATEC-UK’s policy is to reduce the likelihood of a collision with a vulnerable road user or vehicle by risk assessing and implementing the following identified control measures. Where vehicles are travelling forward, we will ensure: • All vehicles will be operated in accordance with the Highway Code. • Mirrors and blind spots are always checked twice before signalling and manoeuvring. • The driver is fully aware of the speed limits of the vehicle they are driving. • All indirect vision aids are checked before travelling. • Drivers must use indirect vision aids provided on the vehicle. • Where vehicles are reversing, we will ensure: • All vehicles above 3.5 tonnes will have reversing cameras fitted. • If available, all reversing manoeuvres of vehicles without 360-degree field of vision will be controlled by a trained and competent banksman. • Where a banksman is not provided, drivers must walk the reversing route to ensure it is clear. Drivers must not rely on reversing cameras alone. • Reversing must be limited by planning the vehicle route in advance. Where vehicles are towing, we will ensure: • The driver has the correct category qualification to tow the trailer. • The driver has checked to confirm that the vehicle is capable of towing the trailer. • Vehicle registration and rear lights are visible and operational before towing commences. • That the towing vehicle does not exceed 50 mph when towing. • The towed trailer is positioned by a driver and another competent person. • All vehicles must tow in accordance with the Highway Code. Where vehicles are parking, we will ensure: • Vehicles are never parked over prohibited road markings. • Parked vehicles must not block or hinder access or rights of way. • All vehicles are parked in accordance with the Highway Code. • All vehicles must follow the PIE sequence; Park, Isolate engine and Engage handbrake. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
