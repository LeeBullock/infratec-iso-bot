The health and safety of vulnerable road users, the travelling public and our drivers is fundamental to the success of our business.  We believe there is never any conflict between the company’s long-term success and our obligation to keep our employees and members of the public safe – at all times. It is INFRATEC-UK’s policy to ensure our drivers remain safe and healthy, and that we continually reduce our work-related road risk. INFRATEC-UK will: • Carry out driver eyesight checks at least every 6 months. • Document any medical condition or prescribed medication being taken on the Driver Medical Log held on the Fleet Management SharePoint server. • Ensure that all drivers have a Safety Critical Medical conducted every 3 years by a competent person with certificates held in the Management System SharePoint server Eyesight Checks • The Transport Manager will carry out eyesight checks every 6 months for all drivers and log the results on the Eyesight check spreadsheet. • The eyesight check will involve a test for each driver to read a vehicle registration plate for a distance of 20m. • If the driver wears glasses, they are allowed to wear them. • It is a requirement that any driver that fails an eyesight or is involved in an incident or near miss, visits an optician.  A record of the optician appointment will be recorded in the relevant persons personnel file. To adhere to this policy a driver must report the following health and fitness aspects as outlined in the FMP002 – Driver Responsibility Policy which forms part of the Fleet Operators Manual. • Changes in their health that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Changes in their eyesight that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Medicine that they have taken that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Illicit drugs that they have taken. • Alcohol consumption that takes the driver over the limit.
