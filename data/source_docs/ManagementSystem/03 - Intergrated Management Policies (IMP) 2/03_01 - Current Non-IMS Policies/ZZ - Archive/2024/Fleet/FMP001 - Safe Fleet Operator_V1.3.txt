  SAFE FLEET OPERATOR O  POLICY  Introduction At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety. The health and safety of vulnerable road users, the travelling public and our drivers is fundamental to the success of our business.  We believe there is never any conflict between the company’s long-term success and our obligation to keep our employees and members of the public safe – at all times. It is INFRATEC-UK’s policy to create a culture in which all those affected by our operations remain safe and healthy, and that we maintain and operate our fleet so that we continually reduce our work-related road risk. Objectives • Manage all our work-related road risks. • Continually improve our fleet capability.  • Ensure all drivers are healthy, trained and competent to undertake their job safely. • Take greater social responsibility when operating and routing our fleet. • Continually reduce the risk of a collision between large goods vehicles and vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. • Consult with drivers to ensure they understand how to keep themselves and others safe. In order to meet these objectives, INFRATEC-UK will maintain an externally accredited fleet management system that complies to the Fleet Operators Recognition Scheme (FORS) standards. The implementation of our fleet management system is a Management responsibility and relies upon the competence, cooperation and commitment of all drivers. INFRATEC-UK Senior Management Team will therefore: • Actively involve our employees in developing and sustaining a positive driver culture which demonstrates strong leadership and commitment. • Develop the necessary competencies in our drivers through; the provision of information, training, instruction and supervision as required, to enable them to perform their responsibilities. • Establish effective organisational communication, cooperation and control arrangements with documented safe operating procedures and guidance where appropriate. • Seek driver, and where appropriate, client participation and views on fleet matters through a consultative process.
