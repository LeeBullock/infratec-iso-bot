  DRIVER RESPONSIBILITY O  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.   Ensuring that our drivers are fit, trained and competent to operate their vehicle is key to ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users, the travelling public and the driver themselves.  This policy requires the driver to report any of the following to their Supervisor and Transport Manager. • Changes to their driving licence details. • Penalty points, fines or bans that have been issued. • Changes in their health that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Changes in their eyesight that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Medicine that they have taken that may impair their ability to drive safely. • Illicit drugs that they have taken. • Alcohol consumption that takes the driver over the limit. • Any events when the driver has been stopped by the Police, VOSA or the DVSA. • Vehicle faults at the pre-start vehicle inspection.  Where drivers are feeling unwell, or if they are taking medication that may affect their ability to drive, the driver must immediately inform their Supervisor. The Supervisor will take a collaborative approach with the driver and once reviewed the Supervisor will decide if the driver is safe to drive or if other arrangements need to be made. The Supervisor may request assistance and guidance from the Transport Manager or Senior Management as to whether the driver is in a fit state to drive a vehicle.  Whilst driving, the driver has responsibility for: • The conduct of their passengers. • Security of loads being transported. • The speed of the vehicle. • The condition and security of the vehicle. • Where appropriate, ensuring that the vehicle does not idle for more than 15 minutes. • Using vision aids and safety features to protect vulnerable road users. • Notifying the Transport Manager of a vehicle collision. • Notifying the Police within 24 hours if a vehicle has not stopped at the scene of a collision.  Failure to comply with this policy may result in a breach of the law and the relevant enforcement agency taking direct action against the driver. Where driver actions constitute a breach of this policy, disciplinary action may be taken against the driver.  Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
