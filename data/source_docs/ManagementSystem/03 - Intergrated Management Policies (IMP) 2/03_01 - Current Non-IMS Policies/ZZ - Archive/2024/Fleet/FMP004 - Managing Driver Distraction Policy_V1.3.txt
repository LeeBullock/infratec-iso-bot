  MANAGING DRIVER  DISTRACTION O  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  The health & safety of our drivers, vulnerable road users and the travelling public is fundamental to our operations. INFRATEC-UK recognise that in order for our drivers to drive safely and within the law, they must give 100% of their attention to the road whilst driving. This cannot be achieved if a driver is distracted by completing other activities whilst driving. The aim of this policy is to ensure that our drivers are the safest that they can be on the road, so it is of primary importance that they must not be distracted whilst driving. This policy prohibits any driver of an INFRATEC-UK vehicle from: • Manually activating or operating any in-vehicle technology whilst driving. • Manually activating or operating mobile phones. • Smoking, eating or drinking whilst driving. • Dressing, undressing or grooming whilst driving. • Operating media devices. • Map reading. • Manually wiping the windscreens whilst driving. This policy also prohibits passengers from distracting the driver through inappropriate actions. To adhere to this policy a driver must: • Pre-set satellite navigation devices with the destination before the journey commences. • Place mobile phones in a secure location out of arms reach. • Mobile phones must be placed on silent mode for the duration of the journey. The company recognises that mobile communications are essential in the modern age and this policy allows drivers to operate or activate in-vehicle technology only if the following criteria are met: • The vehicle must be parked in a safe place. • The vehicle engine is isolated. • The vehicle handbrake is engaged. Failure to comply with this policy may result in a breach of the law and the relevant enforcement agency taking direct action against the driver. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
