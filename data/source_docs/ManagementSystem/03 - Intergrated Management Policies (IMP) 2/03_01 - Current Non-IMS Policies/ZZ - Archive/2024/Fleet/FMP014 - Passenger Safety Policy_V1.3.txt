 Where vehicles are accessible to disabled passengers, drivers must ensure: • Passengers are requested to stow luggage/personal items in storage shelves/lockers above their seats. • Gangways and emergency exits are clear and not obstructed. • Restraint systems are safely stowed when not in use. • Wheelchairs/frames are secured within the vehicle and are accessible in an emergency. • Instructions on securing/releasing accessibility restraints are given to wheelchair passengers or are readily visible. • On-board instructions and notices applicable to passengers are clear, clean and visible. • Emergency equipment (first aid kit / fire extinguisher) is regularly serviced/working. Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Checks In the main, INFRATEC-UK does not conduct DBS checks as its current operations do not require it to do so. However, the company does understand and recognise that if this changed, drivers/staff who were to encounter passengers within the role of an escort or conductor would require a pre-employment check through the Disclosure Barring Service. If this became a requirement for the company, employment would not commence until a satisfactory application certificate had been received or an online check had confirmed an employee has no criminal record or restrictions placed upon them with regards to working with vulnerable adults and/or children. In addition, all customer contact staff requiring DBS clearance would be checked at least once every three years. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
