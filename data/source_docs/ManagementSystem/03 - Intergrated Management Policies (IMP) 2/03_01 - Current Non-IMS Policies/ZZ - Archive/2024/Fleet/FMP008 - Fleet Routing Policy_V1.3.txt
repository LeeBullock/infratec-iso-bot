  FLEET ROUTINGO  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  The health & safety of our drivers, vulnerable road users and the travelling public is fundamental to our operations. INFRATEC-UK’s policy is to reduce the negative transport effects on local communities and the environment by working with our clients to develop and risk assess a logistics plan and minimise potential conflicts with vulnerable road users. The Logistics Plan will be: • Communicated to all our drivers so that they are aware of an understand their obligations. • Monitor restricted route infractions by drivers using vehicle trackers and issue disciplinary warnings as required. To protect vulnerable road users and the travelling public on route, we will:  • Ensure that delivery drivers are made aware of the client’s risk assessed traffic routes (if available) and schedule deliveries to avoid peak hours within the local community wherever possible. • Where we are the client, we will distribute maps and other appropriate route information to all companies and drivers accessing our site. • Ensure that the client has specified circumstances (if any) under which drivers may deviate the specified routes. • Where practical, leave large vehicles on site to reduce large vehicle movements. To control site traffic at peak hours, we will:  • Seek to reduce congestion and risk of collisions in the vicinity of the site by minimising deliveries, collections and servicing access during peak times. • We shall document actions taken to reduce congestion and risk of collisions in the clients Logistic Plan. • We will ensure that proper planning prevents undue pressure being placed on drivers to meet shirt time slots through contractual, economic or management pressure when planning fleet movements. On site, we will:  • Ensure that our clients are aware of our vehicle requirements for safe access and egress from site. • Assist our clients to appropriately manage their site accesses and egresses by ensuring that they are clearly marked, understood and clear or obstacles. • We will ensure that traffic management reduces and eliminates vehicle related risk by  installing one-way systems, temporary traffic lights, traffic calming measures, additional safety equipment e.g. blind sport mirrors. • We will ensure that adequately trained and competent marshals are available to assist with safe vehicle manoeuvring. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
