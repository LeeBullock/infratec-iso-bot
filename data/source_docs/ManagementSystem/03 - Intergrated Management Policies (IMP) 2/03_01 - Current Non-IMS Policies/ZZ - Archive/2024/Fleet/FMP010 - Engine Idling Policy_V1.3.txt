  ENGINE IDLINGO  POLICY  INFRATEC-UK recognise that it needs to efficiently manage its fuel consumption to reduce the impact of our fleet’s operations on the local and global environment. INFRATEC-UK’s policy requires drivers to switch off their engine 30 seconds after they stop travelling. This will reduce the instances of unnecessary engine-idling whilst loading, waiting or in stationary traffic. Reduction of unnecessary engine-idling will reduce the impact our emissions on public health and the environment. It will also lead to increased fuel and engine efficiency for these vehicles. We define unnecessary engine idling as an event where the engine is switched on for more than 15 minutes without producing productive work. Occurrences of engine idling include, but are not limited to: • Loading and offloading of materials by other items of plant. • Whilst on site, operatives waiting for work instructions. • Vehicles stationary within standing traffic. • Static vehicles in work areas that require beacons to remain flashing. We will reduce the occurrence of unnecessary engine idling by: • Communicating the benefits of reducing engine idling and highlighting the dangers associated with unnecessary engine idling to all our drivers. • Ensuring our drivers receive Toolbox Talk training on the need to reduce engine idling times. • Researching and procuring new fleet vehicles with anti-idling technologies and more efficient engines. • Changing old hazard beacons to new LED-type to that the engine is not required to be on when static. • Where traffic routes are identified as the cause of unnecessary engine idling, we will re-route vehicles in line with our other fleet policies or ensure engines are switched off when not working. Vehicles fitted with PTO switches are exempt from the above as they require the engine to idle to activate the fitted plant equipment. Where driver actions constitute a breach in this policy, disciplinary proceedings may be taken by the Company against the driver. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
