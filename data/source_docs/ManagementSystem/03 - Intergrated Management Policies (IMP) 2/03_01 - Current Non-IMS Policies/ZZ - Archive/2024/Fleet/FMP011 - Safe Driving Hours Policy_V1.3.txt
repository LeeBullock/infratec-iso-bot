  SAFE DRIVING HOURS O  POLICY  Introduction At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  The health & safety of our drivers, vulnerable road users and the travelling public is fundamental to our operations. INFRATEC-UK’s policy is to reduce the likelihood of a driver error causing a collision with a vulnerable road user or vehicle by risk assessing and implementing the following identified control measures. Drivers Hours The rules on hours spent driving are made to help drivers do their job to best of their ability, while helping to ensure that they stay safe and healthy. These rules are NOT for guidance, these are legal requirements, and it is the drivers’ duty to themselves and the Company to ensure they abide by them. Driving Hour Limits Daily Driving Limit 9 hours per day (can be increased to 10 hours twice a week) Weekly Driving Limit Maximum 56 hours (which applies to a fixed week*) Fortnight Driving Limit Maximum 90 hours  Breaks The maximum number of driving hours allowed before a break must be taken is 4.5 hours. Break from driving. 45 minute break from driving must be taken after 4.5 hours driving. A break can be split providing the full 45 minutes is taken after 4.5 hours driving e.g. 1st break of 15 minutes and 2nd break of 30 minutes. *A fixed week starts at 00:00 on a Monday and ends at 23:59 on the following Sunday. Rests Daily Rest 11 hours (reducible to 9 hours, 3 times per week) or 12 hours if split into two periods (1st = 3 hours and 2nd = 9 hours) Weekly Rest 45 hours (reducible to 24 hours every other week providing one full weekly rest taken in any fortnight)  Periods of Work Between Weekly Rests No more than 6 x 24 hours before a weekly rest (45 hours) is required  Working Time (including driving) In accordance with the Working Time Regulations 1998, employees of INFRATEC-UK are not required to work more than 48 hours per week (including driving). This is averaged over a 17 week period. This means that an employee might work more than 48 hours in one week, and less in another during a 17 week period – as long as the average is not more than 48 hours. A maximum working time per week is 60 hours (providing the average is not exceeded). Employees can opt out of this restriction on weekly hours. By signing a Working Time Opt-Out Agreement which indicates that they are prepared to work more than 48 hours in any week This is not a guarantee that employees will be offered work in excess of 48 hours in any week. This is just an indication that they are prepared to opt out of the restriction.

Also, drivers may sign a Driver Workforce Agreement which agrees to work beyond the 10-hour night work limit stated in the regulations but only to the extent where this would not be in breach of other provisions of the regulations or EU Drivers Hours Regulations 3820/85..  Employees are entitled to give 4 weeks’ notice if they wish to cancel these agreements. Such notice should be given in writing. In addition, we will monitor and enforce that every employee has at least 15-minute break for every 6 hours work. A period of at least 24 hours must pass before drivers change their shift from day to night or night to day. Rest periods for all employees are the same as listed above. INFRATEC-UK will: • Monitor driver hours from data downloaded from the Driver Cards no later than every 28 days. • Monitor VDU’s which are downloaded from vehicles no later than every 28 days. • Both pieces of data are uploaded to Tachomaster system and reviewed by the Transport Manager to ensure compliance.  Where drivers have not driven, they must complete a Working Time Directive sheet. The driver must hold a copy of the Working Time Directive sheets for a minimum of 28 days on their person.  After 28 days these must submit it to the Transport Manager for filing. Where driver actions constitute a breach in this policy, disciplinary proceedings may be taken by the Company against the driver. Communication of this Policy This policy statement is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This Policy will be made available to subcontractors working on behalf of the Company and interested parties, as appropriate. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.
