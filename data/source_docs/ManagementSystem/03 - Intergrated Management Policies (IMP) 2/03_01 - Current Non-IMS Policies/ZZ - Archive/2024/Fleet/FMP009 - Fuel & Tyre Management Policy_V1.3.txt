  FUEL & TYRE  MANAGEMENTO  POLICY  INFRATEC-UK recognise that it needs to efficiently manage its fuel and tyre consumption to reduce the impact of our fleet’s operations on the local and global environment. Actively seeking to reduce fuel and tyre consumption will produce less carbon and making our fleet more competitive on the road. Creating efficient drivers has the bonus of creating safer drivers as they reduce speeds, plan routes better and reduce erratic driving behaviour. To ensure that our vehicles are operating efficiently and are driven economically, we will: • Train and develop our driver’s skills so they become more aware of how their driving effects their vehicle’s performance and fuel efficiency. • Issue fuel cards to each vehicle to cut down lost cards and return journeys back to head office to collect communal fuel cards. • Ensure that all drivers accurately record their current vehicle registration and vehicle mileage at the filling station when requested. • Vehicle refuelling records will be collected through the fuel supplier and these will be reviewed at least monthly by the Transport Manager. • Refuelling records will be reviewed as part of the Fleet Management Meeting procedure by Senior Management to establish fleet, vehicle, driver and policy efficiency and identify changes where required. To ensure that tyre performance is identified, and tyre waste is managed in compliance with waste regulations, we will: • Record tyre changes during routine maintenance on the Fleet Management System – Fleetio. • Monitor tyre change data and establish trends in tyre usage. • Only the approved tyre maintenance supplier may change tyres on vehicles above 3.5 tonnes and therefore dispose of tyre waste. • Tyre change records will be reviewed as part of the Fleet Management Meeting procedure by Senior Management to establish fleet, vehicle, driver and policy efficiency and identify changes where required. Failure to comply with this policy may result in a breach of environmental law and the relevant enforcement agency taking direct action against the Company. Where driver actions constitute a breach in this policy, disciplinary proceedings may be taken by the Company against the driver. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
