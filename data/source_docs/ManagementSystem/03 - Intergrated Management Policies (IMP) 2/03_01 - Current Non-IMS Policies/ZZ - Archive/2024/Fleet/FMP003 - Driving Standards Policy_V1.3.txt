  DRIVING  STANDARDS O  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety. The health and safety of vulnerable road users, the travelling public and our drivers is fundamental to the success of our business.  We believe there is never any conflict between the company’s long-term success and our obligation to keep our employees and members of the public safe – at all times. A driver has ultimate responsibility of the vehicle when on the road. Through a driver’s action, or inaction, they can directly affect the safety of vulnerable road users, other road users and themselves. To help the driver identify their legal and company responsibilities, we will issue them with Fleet Operator Manual.  To ensure the safety of vulnerable road users, other road users and our drivers, we have assessed our work-related road risk and identified control measures to reduce the severity and likelihood of a hazard occurring. These control measures are communicated to all drivers through the risk assessments issued in the Fleet Operator Manual. Where the driver believes that they have been asked to do something unsafe, they have the right to refuse to work and raise the issue with their Supervisor or Operations Director. No reprisal action will be taken against the driver who refuses to work because they believe it is unsafe to do so. Drivers are also positively encouraged to report and directly resolve any safety failings to their Supervisor or Operations Director. Speed limits are a legal requirement and are integral to driving safely. To assist drivers with adhering to the roads speed limits we will assess drivers before they drive for the company, issue a copy of the Highway Code, deliver ongoing training about speed limits, track all vehicles speeds for speeding violations. Failure to adhere to the road speed limits will result in relevant enforcement agencies prosecuting the driver. Vulnerable road users include pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists and are a group of road users most at risk of serious injury and death from our vehicles and their movements on the road. To reduce the likelihood of striking a vulnerable road user, we expect all drivers to following specified traffic routes, follow and understand our safe systems of work and be familiar with FMP005 – Safety of Vulnerable Road User Policy, which forms part of the Fleet Operator Manual. When a breakdown occurs, drivers should ensure that all road users are safe and made aware of the hazard of the stranded vehicle and then report the breakdown following the FMD002 – Breakdown and Recovery Procedure found in the Fleet Operator Manual. Driver’s must ensure that all vehicle safety equipment is present and defect free as part of the pre-use inspection checks. Where safety equipment is damaged or missing, the driver must report it to their Supervisor immediately who will inform the Transport Manager. The vehicle will be quarantined from further use until the fault has been rectified. It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that all passengers use the safety equipment provided for passenger protection. INFRATEC-UK require all driver mobile phones are switched on to silent and placed in a secure location beyond arms reach from the driver. Mobile phones can only be used by the driver if the vehicle has been parked in a safe place, the engine has been isolated and the vehicle handbrake has been engaged. We advise all Supervisors to text or email instructions to drivers and never repeatedly phone the driver if they know that they are driving. All drivers must comply with FMP 04 – Managing Driver Distraction Policy found in the Fleet Management Manual. In-vehicle technology use is distracting to drivers and it is an offence to operate in-vehicle technology whilst driving. It is INFRATEC-UK’s policy that drivers are prohibited from operating any in-vehicle technology whilst driving and are advised to pre-set sat-navs and other technology before embarking on their journey. Further information is contained in FMP004 – Managing Driver Distraction Policy found in the Fleet Operator Manual. Driver impairment through drink or drugs puts everyone at risk and is unacceptable by any employee. Due to the safety critical nature of our work, INFRATEC-UK’s drugs and alcohol limits are stricter than legal drugs and

alcohol limits. All employees are briefed and issued a copy of the company policy Drug & Alcohol Policy. Failure to adhere to this policy may lead to disciplinary action being taken which could result in dismissal. INFRATEC-UK does not expect any driver to report to work tired. We ensure that when work is programmed, driver hour legislation is adhered to. Where work is located over 3 hours away, we will review and arrange accommodation away from home. We will monitor and enforce driver’s hours to ensure that drivers do not exceed current legislation. In addition, we will monitor and enforce that every employee has at least 15-minute break for every 6 hours work. A period of at least 24 hours must pass before drivers change their shift from day to night or night to day. All drivers are briefed and issued a copy of FMP011 – Safe Driving Hours Policy found in the Fleet Operator Manual. Failure for drivers to accurately record their breaks may mean that they get directly fined by enforcement agencies and repeated failures may result in disciplinary action being taken. Drivers should always park considerately and never block public access routes. When parking, the driver must always isolate the vehicle’s engine, engage the handbrake and removed the keys from the vehicle. When the vehicle is not attended, all doors must be fully locked. This will reduce the likelihood of the vehicle being stolen or accessed by unauthorised personnel. Vehicle emissions are harmful to both people and the environment. The simplest measure to reduce unnecessary emissions is to reduce the time the vehicle engine is spent idling. Drivers that are not travelling and have not engaged the vehicle’s PTO switch, must switch off their vehicle’s engine where possible. Further information is contained within the FMP010 – Engine Idling Policy found in the Fleet Operator Manual  Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
