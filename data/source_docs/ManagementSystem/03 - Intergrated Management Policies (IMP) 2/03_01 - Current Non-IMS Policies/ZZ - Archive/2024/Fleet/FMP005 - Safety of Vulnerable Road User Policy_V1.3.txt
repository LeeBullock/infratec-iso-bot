  SAFETY OF VULNERABLE  ROAD USER O  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  The health & safety of vulnerable road users, the travelling public and our drivers is fundamental to our operations. INFRATEC-UK’s policy is to ensure that vulnerable road users are kept safe and do not come to harm through our operations.  INFRATEC-UK will: • Apply prominent warning signs to all our vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight to inform vulnerable road users of the dangers associated with the close proximity of the vehicle. • Ensure fitment of side-guards or side under-run protection to both sides of vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight to prevent entrapment of vulnerable road users when the vehicles are turning. • At a minimum, ensure fitment of in-direct vision aids to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight to reduce the risk of close proximity blind-spot collisions. • Ensure that all drivers recognise that the continual use, pre-use daily inspection and maintenance of the fitted vulnerable road user protection measures is an integral part of their job. This will be communicated through; policy briefings, training, toolbox talks, driver daily pre-use inspections, Transport Manager inspections and communicated risk assessments. • Ensure that all drivers undertake continual training to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills and attitude to recognise, manage and reduce the risks that our vehicles pose to vulnerable road users. • Document and externally report to the appropriate regulatory third parties any vehicle incidents to ensure that we continually improve our policies and procedures to ensure that they are effective as possible in protecting vulnerable road users. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
