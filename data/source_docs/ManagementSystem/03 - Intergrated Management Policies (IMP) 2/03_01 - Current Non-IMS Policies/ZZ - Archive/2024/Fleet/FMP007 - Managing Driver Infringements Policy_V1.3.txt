  MANAGING DRIVER INFRINGEMENTSO  POLICY  At INFRATEC-UK, we pride ourselves in our robust safety procedures and our culture and performance reflect our commitment to safety.  Driver infringements are evidence of poor performance that may put the driver or INFRATEC-UK at risk of not complying with the law or meeting our operator licence undertakings. Infringements include incidents of: • Poor time keeping. • Poor preventative maintenance. • Vehicle tracker data identifying speeding. • External complaints. • Internal complaints / observations through CAR Forms. • DVSA issued prohibitions. • Graduated fixed penalties. • Notices of intended prosecution from the Police. • Parking offences and prosecutions pursued by any enforcement authority. INFRATEC-UK’s policy is to improve the standard and awareness of its drivers by continually monitoring for river infringements, engaging with drivers to establish route causes, provide training to drivers to prevent reoccurrence or where persistent infringements are evident, remove these drivers from our fleet. INFRATEC-UK will: • Provide training to drivers to ensure they are trained and competent to safely drive and use the equipment provided. • Manage Tachograph records in Tachomaster for review. • Identify driver infringements and inform the drivers of the issues. • Have one-to-one meeting with the driver to sign acknowledgment of their infringements. • Identify and analyse root causes of the infringement. • Where required, we will provide additional training to prevent future infringements. • Retain all documents associated with the infringements for the length of their service with the company. • Document the infringement on the Driver Concern Register, which is reviewed as part of the Fleet Management Review meeting process. • Monitor and review driver performance to ensure the correct driving standards are maintained. Where persistent lesser infringements or more serious infringements occur, then disciplinary procedures will be taken against the driver. Failure to improve may lead to dismissal. Communication of this Policy This policy is communicated to all INFRATEC employees, it is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers. This policy will be reviewed at least annually.      David Bullock Managing Director For and on behalf of the Senior Management Team
