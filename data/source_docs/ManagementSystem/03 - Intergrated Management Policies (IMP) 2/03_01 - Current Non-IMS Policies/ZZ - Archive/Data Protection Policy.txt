Scope of this policy  This policy applies to all forms of data handling at INFRATEC-UK Limited or on its behalf, manual or automated, in paper, electronic or any other form and to all categories of data without limitation.  Principles of data handling  When handling any data at INFRATEC-UK Limited, you should always operate within the following principles:  Principle 1: Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency  All data at INFRATEC-UK Limited shall be processed lawfully and fairly. Where personal data, including sensitive data, is handled, this shall also be done in a manner transparent to the identified or identifiable person to which the data refers.  There must always exist a legal basis as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the collecting, storing and processing of all data. If in doubt, you must consult with the Office Manager.  Principle 2: Purpose, Limitation and Relevance  Data at INFRATEC-UK Limited is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. This data is never processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. This means that when collecting and/or processing data, you should always specify exactly what the data will be used for and limit any handling and processing to only what is necessary to meet the specified purpose.  Where the purpose for processing data is no longer valid or there no longer exists a valid legal basis for it, the data must be securely deleted.  Principle 3: Accuracy  You should always take every reasonable step to ensure that data is accurate and kept up to date. Where data is known to be wrong, it should be rectified without delay. If you are unable to correct the data, you should report any inaccuracies with the aim to get it amended.  Principle 4: Personal and sensitive data held  Unless explicitly allowed by the IT Manager, all personal data and all sensitive data must be held and processed on the INFRATEC-UK Limited central server or paper copies kept in secure cabinets.  Principle 5: Storage Limitation and Retention  Personal and sensitive data shall be kept for no longer than necessary for the purpose for which the data is collected, stored and processed. Where possible, data that is retained for historic, statistical or other relevant purposes should be anonymised as much as possible.  Principle 6: Security, Integrity and Confidentiality  All data at INFRATEC-UK Limited should always be handled in a manner that is secure and that maintains the data’s integrity and confidentiality. All necessary precautions must be taken to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing, against accidental loss, destruction or damage and against theft.  
Handling sensitive data  You must not, under any circumstance, collect, store, access or process sensitive data unless you have been authorised to do by the Office Manager or the IT Manager.  Sending data to third parties  Sharing data with third parties must only be done where strictly necessary, in a way that is secure, lawful and fair and with the explicit approval of either the Office Manager or the IT Manager.  Wherever data is transmitted to third parties, this must always be done using an approved method.
