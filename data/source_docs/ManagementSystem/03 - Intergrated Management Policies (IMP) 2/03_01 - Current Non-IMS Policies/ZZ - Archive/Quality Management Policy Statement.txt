QUALITY MANAGEMENT  POLICY STATEMENT  INFRATEC-UK Limited is committed to implementing and maintaining a quality as part of its Integrated Management System and is dedicated to meeting the requirements of its customers and of all regulatory requirements applicable to its products.  The aim of the Integrated Management System is to ensure that: • We deliver a quality product to maintain excellent customer relations  • Customer satisfaction remains inherent to our business  • Our customer’s requirements have been fully understood  • All work is carried out consistently to a defined standard  • We have the skills and resources to fulfil our customer requirements  • Our staff are fully trained and involved in the delivery of a quality product  • Objectives are established and reviewed to continuously improve our processes  • We only use services that meet our own quality assurance standards  • A professional approach to customer interface is maintained at all times  • Any complaints are dealt with efficiently and within an acceptable time period  The framework of the Integrated Management System will also identify quality objectives for continual improvement of the system and the overall performance of the company.  These objectives will ensure that all of the INFRATEC’s activities are planned and resourced in a consistent way and that all customer and legal requirements are met in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  To ensure that its quality objectives are achieved, INFRATEC-UK Limited will maintain an externally accredited Management System that complies with the requirements of BS EN ISO 9001:2015 and will include the requirements of the NHSS 8.  The implementation of our Integrated Management System is a management responsibility and relies upon the competence, cooperation and commitment of all employees and subcontractors. We will therefore:  • Actively involve our employees and subcontractors in developing and sustaining a positive quality culture which demonstrates strong leadership and commitment  • Develop the necessary competencies in our own employees and subcontractors, through the provision of information, training, instruction and supervision as required, to enable them to discharge their responsibilities  • Establish effective organisational communication, cooperation and control arrangements with documented procedures and guidance where appropriate, and  • Seek employee participation and views on quality matters through the use of appropriate consultative mechanisms  Though the Managing Director has ultimate responsibility for quality, all employees have a responsibility within their own areas of work so helping to ensure that quality is embedded within the whole of the company. This policy is posted on the Company Notice Board, available to all employees on the company’s SharePoint Servers and can also be found in the staff handbook.
