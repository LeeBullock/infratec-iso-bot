  DIGNITY AT WORK CO  POLICY STATEMENT  Introduction All employees have the right to be treated with respect and dignity and to work in an environment that is fair, inclusive and free from harassment, bullying and intimidation.  INFRATEC is committed to ensuring that any allegation of harassment or bullying at work is taken seriously, is properly investigated, and is dealt with effectively.  This Policy applies to harassment or bullying on the grounds of gender, race, nationality, age, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or any other personal characteristic.  This policy takes into account of the provisions of the Equality Act 2010.  Principles • We will create a working environment where all employees are valued and respected for their unique contribution to the business and are not subject to inappropriate or unwanted behaviour by colleagues or third parties, for example a customer, client or supplier.  • Inappropriate behaviour by any employee will not be tolerated be it carried out by colleagues to peers, by one group to another individual member, by a manager to an employee, by an employee to a manager, or by an employee to a third party, for example customer, client or supplier .  • Any inappropriate behaviour by a third party towards an INFRATEC employee will not be tolerated.  • All allegations will be managed accordingly and if appropriate a full and objective investigation will take place. If any allegations are upheld this may result in disciplinary and/or criminal proceedings.  • Employees making a complaint will be protected from victimisation.  • Employees who make malicious complaints which are found to be untrue will be subject to disciplinary action. Relevant Definitions Harassment is defined as any unwanted behaviour that has the effect of violating dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. This includes jokes or banter and extends to work related environments such as work social events. Harassment can take many forms and occur for a variety of reasons. It can be persistent behaviour over a period of time, but a one-off act, providing it is serious, may also amount to harassment. Examples of harassing behaviour include:  • unwanted physical contact  • banter, offensive language, gossip, slander  • posters, graffiti, obscene gestures  • isolation or non-cooperation and exclusion from social activities  • intrusion by pestering, spying and stalking  • failure to safeguard confidential information  Bullying is defined as the abuse of power or position which results in persistent, vindictive, cruel or humiliating attempts to undermine, criticise, condemn or to hurt or humiliate an individual or group of employees.  The Trade Union Congress has identified several bullying behaviours including:  • Shouting at staff  • Deliberately excluding someone from work activities  • Blocking promotion  • Setting up someone to fail through unrealistic targets or deadlines  • Regularly making someone the butt of jokes  Victimisation is defined as unfavourable treatment specifically as a result of an individual making a claim or complaint of discrimination or harassment.  
Raising a Complaint  Anyone who believes that they are being treated unfairly, without dignity or being made the subject of bullying or harassment should report this. Anyone who witnesses any of these behaviours should report this.  INFRATEC employees should make a report to their people manager, second line manager or to the Company Secretary.  Contractors, customers or any other third party should make a report to INFRATEC senior management  Responding to a Complaint The manager responding to the complaint should consider the seriousness of the complaint and respond accordingly.  In most cases where the situation is not too severe an informal approach is most effective, in the first instance. Some people may not be aware that their behaviour is unwelcome, offensive or makes others feel uncomfortable. Using an informal approach gives the alleged harasser the opportunity to stop if directly approached by a colleague or manager and allows for colleagues to work together.  However, where an informal approach does not stop the bullying or harassment, or where the individual making the complaint or the manager dealing with the complaint feels that the situation is so serious that formal action is required. If the complaint is made by an INFRATEC employee, then they should make a formal written complaint following the company’s Grievance Policy. If the complaint is made by a customer, contractor, or other third party, then they should make a formal written complaint to INFRATEC management, leading to response under INFRATEC’s complaints procedure.
