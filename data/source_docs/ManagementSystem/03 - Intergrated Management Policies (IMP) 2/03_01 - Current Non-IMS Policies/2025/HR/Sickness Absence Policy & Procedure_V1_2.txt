  SICKNESS ABSENCE  POLICY STATEMENT & PROCEDURE  Purpose INFRATEC-UK is committed to supporting the health and well-being of its employees. The purpose of this Sickness Policy is to ensure that employees understand the company's expectations when they are unable to work due to illness or injury, and to outline the procedures for reporting sickness and absences. The policy also provides clarity regarding the company’s approach to sickness-related leave, pay, and support. Scope This policy applies to all employees of INFRATEC-UK, including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. It outlines the procedure to be followed when an employee is unable to attend work due to illness or injury, and covers the types of sickness leave, pay entitlements, and expectations for returning to work. Reporting Sickness Absence Employees who are unable to attend work due to illness or injury are required to: • Notify the company as soon as possible: Employees should notify their line manager or supervisor at no later than 10am on the first day of absence. • Provide details: The employee should provide the reason for the absence and, if possible, an expected return date. • Stay in regular contact: If the employee’s absence extends beyond one day, they should keep their manager updated on their condition and expected return date, preferably every 3 days.   If the employee is unable to reach their line manager directly, they should contact the Commercial Manager. Medical Certification • Short-term sickness (1-7 days): For absences lasting less than 7 calendar days, employees are not required to provide a doctor’s note. However, they may be asked to complete a self-certification form upon their return to work. • Long-term sickness (8+ days): If the employee is absent for 8 or more consecutive days, they will be required to provide a medical certificate (fit note) from their doctor to confirm their inability to work. This certificate must be submitted to their line manager as soon as possible. Sickness Pay INFRATEC-UK provides a sickness pay policy based on statutory sick pay (SSP). Statutory Sick Pay (SSP): Employees are entitled to SSP if they are off sick for at least 4 consecutive days and meet the eligibility criteria. SSP is paid for up to 28 weeks. Sickness Leave and Absence Monitoring INFRATEC-UK monitors employee sickness absences to ensure that absences are being reported appropriately and that any trends are identified. If an employee has frequent short-term absences or a prolonged period of sickness, their manager may request a meeting to discuss the situation and assess if any additional support or adjustments are needed. Return to Work Employees are expected to return to work when they are fit and able to do so. On their return to work after sickness, employees should: • Complete a return-to-work interview: Employees should meet with their line manager or HR representative to discuss the sickness absence, ensure a smooth return to work, and address any concerns. 
• Provide a doctor’s note: If the employee has been absent for more than 7 days, they will need to provide a medical certificate (fit note) confirming they are fit to return to work. In cases of long-term illness, INFRATEC-UK will work with employees to explore reasonable adjustments or accommodations, if needed, to facilitate their return to work. Employee Support INFRATEC-UK understands that illness or injury can impact both physical and mental well-being. We encourage employees to seek support when needed and provide the following resources: • Occupational Health Services: In cases of long-term sickness or complex health issues, employees may be referred to occupational health services for further assessment and support. • Mental Health Support: INFRATEC-UK encourages open dialogue about mental health and offers support through various programs, including mental health first aiders, counselling services, and flexible working arrangements. Absences Due to Pregnancy or Maternity Leave Absences due to pregnancy-related illness or maternity leave will be managed in accordance with the company’s Maternity Leave Policy and in compliance with statutory rights. Long-Term Sickness and Adjustments If an employee is absent for a prolonged period due to illness, INFRATEC-UK will work with the employee to explore reasonable adjustments to support their return to work, including flexible working hours, job modifications, or temporary changes in duties. Abuse of the Sickness Policy INFRATEC-UK takes any abuse of the sickness policy seriously. If it is suspected that an employee is falsely reporting sickness or abusing sick leave, an investigation will be conducted. Disciplinary action may be taken if there is evidence of policy abuse, up to and including dismissal. Confidentiality All sickness-related information, including medical certificates and details of the employee’s condition, will be treated with the highest level of confidentiality and in compliance with data protection regulations. Implementation The Managing Director is responsible for the implementation of this policy and other related policies and procedure, including the communication and detailed interpretation, monitoring and any disciplinary action in response to an apparent breach of this policy. The Company Secretary is responsible for maintaining and reviewing this policy, and for clarifying and resolving general issues. The Company Secretary will oversee any audit of policy compliance on behalf of the Managing Director, which may be considered necessary.
