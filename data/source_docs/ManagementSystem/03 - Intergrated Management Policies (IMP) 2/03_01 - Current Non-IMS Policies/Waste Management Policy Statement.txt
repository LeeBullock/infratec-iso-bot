WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICY STATEMENT  INFRATEC-UK is conscious of its responsibility for the protection and improvement of the environment and is committed to minimising environmental impact throughout its sphere of activities. It is the aim of INFRATEC-UK to carry out its operations, according to the procedures given herein, and to the latest good practice guidelines. Management and Site Staff are responsible for the operation and implementation of the Policy and all subcontractors are expected to co-operate with the company in order to fulfil its legal obligations. Our procedures will cover the following areas and will be reviewed annually or as changes in legislation dictate: • We will only use skip suppliers who can offer an off site waste recycling service and provide a full monthly breakdown of quantities and types of materials recycled. • We will work with our suppliers to reduce packaging (including the use of pallets) and recycle as required. • We will look to re-use waste on site where this is appropriate. • Our staff will be dedicated to the management of waste on site (All skips will leave site full and correct waste transfer procedures followed). • Our staff and Sub Contractors will actively reduce waste by ordering the correct quantities of materials, and store and use them in order to minimise waste. Materials will be ordered, when economic, to arrive just on time to minimise possibility of damage through handling and storage and will be rejected if they arrive damaged or incorrect. • During Site Induction all labour will be informed of our onsite procedures and actively encouraged to run a ‘TIDY’ site. The Operations Director having particular responsibility for waste management procedures and will report to the Senior Management Team on such matters.
