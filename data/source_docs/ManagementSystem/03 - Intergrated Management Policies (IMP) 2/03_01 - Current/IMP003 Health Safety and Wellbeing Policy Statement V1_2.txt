everyone. We will develop systems to ensure full compliance with legislation and continuous improvement in our performance.

against the strategy will be reviewed each year.

45001:2018. This provides the framework to help drive continual improvement and share best health and safety best practice
throughout our business and provide sufficient resources to implement this policy in full.
• implement a rigorous process of hazard identification and risk assessment which drives the development of controls that
minimise the possibility of injury or ill health.

safety key performance indicators and associated performance targets. Performance will be communicated monthly to the
business and made available to all employees.

workers and, where they exist, their representatives to contribute to improvements in our health and safety performance.
