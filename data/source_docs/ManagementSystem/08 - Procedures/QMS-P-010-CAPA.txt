INFRATEC Nonconformity & Corrective Action (CAPA) Process:
- Log all nonconformities with date, owner, and description.
- Contain the issue and assess impact.
- Perform root-cause analysis (e.g., 5-Why or Fishbone).
- Define corrective actions, assign owners, and set due dates.
- Verify effectiveness of corrective actions before closing.
- Trend CAPA data and review during Management Review.
